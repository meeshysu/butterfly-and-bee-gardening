However, if you have pets that like to chew on plants, any Milkweed is not a viable choice. The plant contains a sappy white goo that is toxic. Aphids also really like Milkweed, which is a bothersome pest. They will not hurt the plant - as in it won't die on you - but it is annoying and ugly. When you don't have any eggs or any chrysalis on the plant, you can spray the aphids with a mixture of dish detergent soap and water. Just check thoroughly that there are no eggs, it will kill them just as it will the aphids. Zones 8a-11."

Unfortunately this plant is not commonly sold in nurseries, so you may have to buy it by seed. If that's the case, start seeds inside before the final frost arrives.

Mulch around the base of the plant will help retain moisture. This is not a good plant for wet and humid conditions. Beebalm unfortunately attracts Powdery Mildew easily. I do not suggest spraying it, unless you are using a natural and organic fungicide. Still be careful on the timing - don't hit your bees! Any pesticide that enters a bloom will kill the bee or insect that drinks the nectar. It's best to cut off the infected areas and let it go.
